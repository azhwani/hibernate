# Hibernate
Hibernate is a powerful and flexible ORM solution that enbales to "MAP" Java "CLASSES" to database "TABLES"! It is a JPA implementation!
Hibernate provides a query language "HQL" an object-oriented query language, similar to SQL, but instead of operating on tables and columns, HQL works with objects and their properties.
